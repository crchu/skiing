        <h2>More About Skiing</h2>
        <p class="intro-text">After skiing on the West Coast, East Coast, and in Europe, I would say my top pick is definitely 
            Europe, although each region has its own pros and cons. One of the main downsides of skiing is that 
            it can be an expensive hobby, especially when factoring in the cost of ski rentals, lift passes, and 
            lessons. On the West Coast, lift passes are typically more expensive than those on the East Coast and
            in Europe. In fact, Europe generally has cheaper lift passes compared to the U.S., but you have to 
            factor in the cost of flights, which can add up quickly. However, in the U.S., food, lessons, and 
            domestic flights are generally cheaper compared to Europe. Despite the higher costs, European 
            resorts are larger and offer incredible experiences, so it's worth the splurge if you ever get the 
            chance. When I first learned to ski, my parents would take us to smaller resorts where lessons were 
            more affordable. If you're just starting out, I highly recommend visiting smaller resorts until you 
            get the hang of skiing or snowboarding. Not only are lessons more affordable, but rentals and lift 
            passes are usually cheaper as well. When I first skied on the East Coast, I noticed that the slopes 
            tend to be icier, especially in the northern resorts, and conditions are often more challenging the 
            day after rain. Each region has its unique charm, but it's important to consider the conditions and 
            costs when planning your trip.</p>
